# üëÅ Panopticon üëÅ

Read-only web ui for keeping tabs on the GoGoPool Protocol.

Built with modern tech but using old skool techniques. No React/Vue/Svetle/etc. Just locally-sourced, organic HTML and Javascript (ECMA2020).

- Built-in Go web server, so the entire app (web server + html) compiles down into a single binary.
- One-click deploy to [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
- Supports Basic Auth if you don't want it to be publicly available
- Liberal use of `<script type="module">` and https://esm.sh (Look Ma, no build step!)
- Multicall is used to gather data from multiple contracts/functions in one call
- [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info) provides the data tables
- For CB58 encoding using only ethers, check out `utils.js#cb58Encode`
- Deployment definitions can declaratively specify what data to grab from which contract, and how it should be formatted/transformed, making it easily extendable.
- `transformer.js` implements an async pipeline to apply the desired transforms to an array of objects.
